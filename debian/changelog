udisks2 (1.99.0-6) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * debian/udisks2.install: Install umount.udisks2 into /sbin; our old
    util-linux version does not yet find it in /usr/sbin/. (LP: #1019651)

udisks2 (1.99.0-5) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/local/udisks2-inhibit: Fix crash when /run/udisks2 does not exist
    yet. (LP: #1048211)
  * 00git_testsuite.patch: Pull latest test suite updates from trunk. This
    disables the tests for mounting XFS and reiserfs on read-only devices, as
    this is known-broken without a workaround.

udisks2 (1.99.0-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add debian/local/udisks2-inhibit: Hack to disallow udisks2 mount
    operations for anyone but root while a program is running. This is similar
    to udisks 1.x's "udisks --inhibit .." command. Install it into
    /usr/lib/udisks2/.
  * mount_in_media.patch: As on Debian and Ubuntu /media is not currently a
    tmpfs, we need to put the "mounted-fs" file to a persistent path as well.
    Otherwise udisks does not clean up old mount points that it created after
    a reboot. (LP: #1043772)
  * debian/udisks2.postinst: Migrate the mounted-fs file on upgrades.
  * Update 00git_testsuite.patch: Pull latest test suite updates from trunk.
    This now covers handling of existing mount points, and mounting read-only
    devices, which reproduces LP #435192.

udisks2 (1.99.0-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add 00git_dev_t_annotation.patch: Add workaround annotation for
    udisks_client_get_block_for_dev(), to fix UDisks.Block.get_block_for_dev()
    on 32 bit platforms when calling it through introspection. Patch also
    committed to upstream git.
  * Add 00git_testsuite.patch: Pull latest test suite updates from trunk. This
    includes a new test case for permissions for removable devices, plus some
    race condition fixes.
  * mount_in_media.patch: Drop the test suite portion, included in previous
    patch.

udisks2 (1.99.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

    FHS compatible. (Closes: #680403, LP: #1020759)

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Wed, 22 Aug 2012 12:36:09 +0200

udisks2 (1.98.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

    autopkgtest (adapted from udisks package).

udisks2 (1.97.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Add udev build dependency, as configure.uc needs its
    pkg-config file to check for the udev directory. Fixes FTBFS.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Wed, 23 May 2012 11:40:02 +0200
