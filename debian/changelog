    Patch backported from current upstream git head.

    upstream git. 1.99 and later will ship that in the source tarball.
  * Add debian/tests/control and debian/tests/upstream-system: DEP-8
    autopkgtest (adapted from udisks package).
  * debian/control: Change suggestion of cryptsetup to cryptsetup-bin, as that
    is sufficient for udisks' needs.
